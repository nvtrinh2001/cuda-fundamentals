Atomics

Merge 3 instructions: read c, add R1 & R2 to R3, store R3 to c into 1 instruction
Facilitated by special hardware in the L2 cache
Performance may have to suffer

atomicMax/Min – choose the max (or min)
atomicAdd/Sub – add to (or subtract from)
atomicInc/Dec – increment (or decrement) and account for rollover/underflow
atomicExch/CAS – swap values, or conditionally swap values
atomicAnd/Or/Xor – bitwise ops

Could be used to determine next work item, queue slot, etc.
int my_position = atomicAdd(order, 1);
Most atomics return a value that is the “old” value that was in the location receiving the atomic update.
